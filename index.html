<h10>Interests and Hobbies</h10><hr>
<p3>In comparison to a lot of my peers, my interests are pretty plain.  I enjoy traveling, listening to music, hanging out with my friends, reading, playing video games, and walking.  Some places that I have been to China, Taiwan, New York City, and Seattle.  My music taste mainly is a mixture of genre's and artists.  For exmaple I really like listening to blues/jazz, rap, R&B and pop.  In addition, my favorite series is Harry Potter, but Percy Jackson and Shadow Hunters and the Mortal Instruments come in a close second and third.  And finally my some of my favorite video games are Fallout 4, Skyrim, and Minecraft. <img src="kalani-a.github.io/ff4.png" </p3><hr>
