        Hi my name is Kalani Anderson.  I am currently a junior at James Campbell High School.  I was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and lived there until I was 5, when my family and I moved to Hawaii.  My favorite subjects are science and history, specifically chemistry and world history.  For my post high school plans I want to attend the University of Pennyslvania and study biomedical engineering or chemical engineering.

        Some of my favorite hobbies are reading, listening to music, traveling, and watching TV.  My favorite book series is Harry Potter because it was so different from anything I had read before and the whole Wizarding World amazed me.  Out of all 7 book though, I would say that the fifth one is my personal favorite because it had the most interesting plot.  And some of my favorite TV series that I have watched watched are Friends, Sherlock and the IT Crowd. </p2><hr>
