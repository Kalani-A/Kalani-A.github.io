        Hi my name is Kalani Anderson.  I am currently a junior at James Campbell High School.  I was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania and lived there until I was 5, when my family and I moved to Hawaii.  My favorite subjects are science and history, specifically chemistry and world history.  For my post high school plans I want to attend the University of Pennyslvania and study biomedical engineering or chemical engineering.

        Some of my favorite hobbies are reading, listening to music, traveling, and watching TV.  My favorite book is Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone.  It's my favorite book because not only was it fun to read, but also because it was the gateway book that lead me to one of my favorite fictional universes.  And some of my favorite TV shows that I have watched are Friends, Sherlock and That 70's Show. </p2><hr>
